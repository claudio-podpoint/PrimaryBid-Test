<!-- record your test runs -->
<!-- npx cypress run --record --key 567d5ce3-c2a1-4471-96df-0e0f1ab6332e -->
<!-- create a cypress.env.json to store your values for the url and user auth details -->
<!-- create a private repo -->
## Info 
#### Developed the test cases using the Page Object Model (POM), I think this might be an overkill for this task. The reason I built this way is simply to remove layers of abstraction.

## Installation
#### clone the repo

## Install dependencies

npm install

## Open Cypress DashBoard
#### npx cypress open

#### npm run test

## Report
#### Html report are generated inside the report folder after the test is run for the first time. mohcareports folder constains both a html and json report.

## UI Observations 

#### The Issuers link does not direct the user to a new page/url when the link is clicked which is inconsistent with the other html pages.
